# Welcome!
### This is the welcoming page for the rouge-like map maker I made in about 3-4 days for a game I will be finishing in about a month to two months.
## Usage
### Controls
> + left click to select which tile to chose on the right.
> - use the mouse wheel to scrool through the avalible tiles.
> + left click to place a tile in layer one (used for ground elements).
> - right click to place a tile in layer two (used for objects on the ground elements).
> + middle click to change what type the tile is (nothing, solid, player spawn, player entry, monster spawn, boss spawn) 
> `note: boss spawn will not be used in the game for a while`
### How to get the map into the game
> DM me on Discord for those who know me there.
